      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Think about the last time you played a D&D game. How hard was it to schedule? 
        Did everyone understand the rules or where they could find them? How hard was 
        finding players? Did the game go smoothly? Solving those problems is where my 
        website comes in. I provide a scheduling tool that has a concise scheduling 
        calendar, links to rules and resources that are useful to any game, and room 
        to include any house rules that you want for your table.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My target audience is college age young adults who either have experience with 
        DND, or complete novices. One of the biggest issues of playing a DND game is 
        finding a local group to join.
        The need I am providing is a system for organizing DND sessions, as well as resources for rules, play, and gamemastering. 
        My audience will access my website from desktop, laptop, and mobile devices
              that means that my website will need to be adjusted for all three devices.

      <h4>scheduling</h4>
      <p>
        Dungeons and dragons is an incredibly fun game. 
        While frequently derided as “a game for nerds,”
        the fact that it requires several different people
        to talk and interact with each other shows that is 
        not true. DnD is a game that can be enjoyed by everyone. 
        However, there are several problems that need to be overcome
        for DnD to be enjoyed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The first problem is scheduling. DnD sessions can take several 
        hours, and a campaign requires several sessions that requires all 
        the same people to be available at the same time. This makes it 
        very difficult to get a game going because it’s very difficult to 
        make sure everyone is available, and if one person can’t make it, 
        the others either can’t play, or they need to find a way to do without 
        the missing person. My website will make it easier to schedule by 
        having everyone in a group put the days they are available on a 
        calendar so they can deal with any scheduling problems in advance.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <h4>Player resources</h4>
      <p>
        The second problem is that DnD is a very complex game with 
        several books’ worth of rules. Many players start with barely 
        any idea of what their character is capable of beyond their 
        level, armor class, and hit points. Wizards of the coast has 
        helped to make it easier by making many of the basic rules of 
        the game free to anyone with an internet connection, and many 
        other people help provide useful advice to players and Dungeon 
        Masters both. The problem is that many players don’t know where 
        to find these resources or that the exist at all. My website 
        will have internet hyperlinks leading to the resources I’ve 
        found so players won’t have to hunt them down and I won't have 
        to repeat what several other people have already said.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <h4>FAQ</h4>
      <p>
        The third problem is that some parts of the game simply will 
        not be clear because the authors thought it was obvious. To 
        deal with that issue, my website will have a Frequently Asked 
        Questions page or FAQ that will answer questions such as, 
        ‘what is a proficiency bonus?’ ‘what dice do I roll?’ ‘What 
        does 5d6 mean?’ as well as other questions that newer players 
        will have.
